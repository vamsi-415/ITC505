      <p>Addendum:
        Creating "Haunted Mansion" was an enlightening journey. 
        The primary challenge was structuring the narrative flow to maintain coherence while offering multiple paths and endings.
        I used a JavaScript object to organize story stages, ensuring each decision led to a unique consequence. 
        Integrating images to enhance the visual storytelling was crucial, adding depth to each stage. 
        Accessibility was prioritized by setting appropriate alt text for images. 
        One significant hurdle was dynamically updating the choices presented to the player. 
        This was resolved by clearing and repopulating the choices container with each stage update. 
        Another challenge was ensuring that the transitions between stages were seamless, which required meticulous testing and debugging. 
        This project sharpened my skills in dynamic DOM manipulation and event handling. 
        The final product not only showcases a captivating story but also a robust interactive framework, demonstrating the synergy between storytelling and coding. The journey was filled with creativity, problem-solving, and a deep dive into JavaScript's capabilities.
